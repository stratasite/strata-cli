# from your Strata admins.  You can regenerate/revoke API keys as
# needed on the server.  You must be Developer on a Project to modify
# it or you must be System Manager to be able to create new projects.

# Alternatively, you can configure a server per environment. In that case,
# you will have to pass -e [Environment] option to choose the correct instance.
# server:
#   dev: https://dev.mydomain.net
#   hr: https://hr.mydomain.net
#   prod: https://prod.mydomain.net

# Credentials here are stored per datasource. These credentials
# should be set via `strata ds auth DS_KEY`. DS_KEY should match the datasouces 
# yaml node key for the datasource you are trying to update.
